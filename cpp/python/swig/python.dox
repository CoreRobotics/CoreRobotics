\page python Python Wrapper

A Python wrapper for a portion of the CoreRobotics library has been
generated with SWIG. The CoreRobotics modules included in the wrapper
are:

* - CRClock
* - CRTypes
* - CRMath
* - CRFrame
* - CRFrameEuler
* - CRFrameDh
* - CRRigidBody
* - CRManipulator
* - CRNoiseModel
* - CRNoiseGaussian
* - CRNoiseDirac
* - CRNoiseUniform
* - CRNoiseMixture
* - CRSensorLinear
* - CRInverseKinematics

The Python wrappers can be built by running CMake with `-Dpython=true` to
build the Python wrappers which are located at `python/lib`. To build both
the C++ and Python libraries run `cmake ../ -Dall=true`. These commands use the latest version of Python available on your system. To compile with a specific version use `cmake ../ -Dpython=2` to compile with Python 2 etc. This option can also be used with the `all` flag to compile both the C++ library and the Python library with a specified version, for example `cmake ../ -Dall=true -Dpython=2`.

Examples of how to use the Python wrapper can be found in the examples provided
in the `python/examples` directory.

\warning
* - The CRClock module does not work as expected.
* - The CRMath module has had the Forward Euler and 4th order Runge-Kutta integrators
removed for compatability.
* - The following modules have not been tested:
	* - CRNoiseModel
	* - CRNoiseGaussian
	* - CRNoiseDirac
	* - CRNoiseUniform
	* - CRNoiseMixture
	* - CRSensorLinear
